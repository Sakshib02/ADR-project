# ADR-project
This project aims to build a machine learning framework that can predict ADRs based on pharmacogenomic features (like drug names and reactions from the FAERS dataset). By leveraging models like Logistic Regression, XGBoost, and Neural Networks, we explore how well ADRs can be identified from structured and textual drug data
